# readisten

Readisten and readisten incorporated has provided some open source
text and materials for users, developers, 
scientists, enthusiasts, and professionals.

Readisten transforms data to audio. Current works are based off biomedical research.

We will work with our text to speech and 
robotic speech system providers to
also share any of their software programming
not under patent protection or with public
use allowances/common use/open source.

We do have proprietary database and
software, web, and application development.
These programs are commercial however we
hope to optimize open source access to 
these.

Our spreadsheet organization and data
entries are deemed proprietary however
and part of our transformative product
and services.

However we plan to keep this as an open
source resource for all.

Thank you so much for your interest
and support.
